# SKAdNetworks

This site was created by Digital Turbine (DT) in order to support our DT Fairbid and DT Marketplace publishers in adopting Apple's new SKAdNetwork specification for programmatic ad buying. To participate in install validation for [Apple's SKAdNetwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork/configuring_the_participating_apps) the source app must include the ad networkâ€™s ID in its Info.plist.

Programmatic ad buying uses the following framework for SKAdNetwork:
* DT's publishers are considered source apps under the SKAdNetwork spec
* DT's Demand Partners register and receive ad network IDs from Apple. Each Demand Partner running app install validation on DT Marketplace will have at least one SKAdNetwork ad network ID

DT's recommended list of SKAdNetwork ad network IDs can be found [here](https://fyber-engineering.github.io/SKAdNetworks/). Feel free to either clone or fork this repository. Alternatively, you can directly download or CURL the JSON file containing the mentioned data.

Please do not create pull requests into this project as they will be ignored. The data will be updated periodically by DT's engineering team.
